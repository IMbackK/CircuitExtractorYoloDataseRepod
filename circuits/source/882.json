	"abstract": "A multitude of chemical, biological, and material systems present an inductive behavior that is not electromagnetic in origin. Here, it is termed a chemical inductor. We show that the structure of the chemical inductor consists of a two-dimensional system that couples a fast conduction mode and a slowing down element. Therefore, it is generally defined in dynamical terms rather than by a specific physicochemical mechanism. The chemical inductor produces many familiar features in electrochemical reactions, including catalytic, electrodeposition, and corrosion reactions in batteries and fuel cells, and in solid-state semiconductor devices such as solar cells, organic light-emitting diodes, and memristors. It generates the widespread phenomenon of negative capacitance, it causes negative spikes in voltage transient measurements, and it creates inverted hysteresis effects in current\342\200\223voltage curves and cyclic voltammetry. Furthermore, it determines stability, bifurcations, and chaotic properties associated to self-sustained oscillations in biological neurons and electrochemical systems. As these properties emerge in different types of measurement techniques such as impedance spectroscopy and time-transient decays, the chemical inductor becomes a useful framework for the interpretation of the electrical, optoelectronic, and electrochemical responses in a wide variety of systems. In the paper, we describe the general dynamical structure of the chemical inductor and we comment on a broad range of examples from different research areas.Funding for open access charge: CRUE-Universitat Jaume ",
