	"abstract": "Investigation of phosphate species adsorption/desorption processes was\nperformed on Ag(100) and Ag(111) electrodes in H$_{3}$PO$_{4}$,\nKH$_{2}$PO$_{4}$ and K$_{3}$PO$_{4}$ solutions by Current-Potential ($j-V$)\nprofiles and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy ($EIS$). We used the\nequivalent circuit method to fit the impedance spectra. Different electrical\nequivalent circuits ($EECs$) were employed depending on the potential region\nthat was analyzed. For potentials more negative than the onset of the hydrogen\nevolution reaction ($her$), a charge transfer resistance (R$_{ct}$) in parallel\nto the $(RC)$ branches was included. Peaks from $j-V$ profiles were integrated\nto estimate surface coverage. A reversible process was observed for\nAg(hkl)/KH$_{2}$PO$_{4}$ systems, where a value of 0.07 ML was obtained. For\nAg(111)/H$_{3}$PO$_{4}$, a coverage of about 0.024 ML was calculated from\nanodic/cathodic $j-V$ profiles, whereas for Ag(hkl)/K$_{3}$PO$_{4}$ systems\ndifferent values were obtained from integration of anodic/cathodic peaks due to\nhighly irreversible processes were observed. In the case of\nAg(hkl)/K$_{3}$PO$_{4}$, the capacitance (C$_{(\\phi)}$) plots are well\ndifferentiated for the two faces, and co-adsorption of OH$^{-}$ was evaluated\nfrom resistance parameters. Characteristic face-specific relaxation times are\nobtained for each electrode. In addition, it was found that the onset potential\nof $her$ for Ag(111) at pH=1.60 was about 100 mV more negative compare to\nAg(100).Comment: 31 pages, 10 figures, supporting informatio",
