	"abstract": "A comprehensive system for real-time\r\nmonitoring of a set of cell-cultures using a Voltage Oscillation\r\n(VO) methodology is proposed. The main idea is to connect the\r\nbio-electrical elements (electrodes & cell-culture) in such a way\r\nthat sequentially a suitable electrical oscillator, which only uses\r\na DC power source, is built. Using the employed electrical\r\nmodels given in [1, 2], the attained oscillation parameters\r\n(frequency and amplitude) can be directly related to the\r\nbiological test. A digital circuitry is developed to pick-up the\r\nexperimental measurements, which are gathered and shown in\r\nreal-time in a web application.Ministerio de Econom\303\255a y Competitividad TEC2013-46242-C3-1-",
