	"abstract": "A novel composite electrode was constructed by pressing graphene and CuO, using a cathode in an electro\342\200\220Fenton (EF) system. Cyclic voltammetry, charge/discharge curve and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were used to characterize the composite electrode. The degradation of a toxic organic contaminant, Terramycin, by EF system was studied in an undivided electrolysis cell. The possible degradation products of Terramycin were studied by a Fourier transform\342\200\220infrared spectrum, and the findings showed that the structure of Terramycin was damaged. The variations of hydrogen peroxide and the relative content of hydroxyl radical (.OH) during the degradation process were traced by enzyme catalysis method and fluorescence spectrometry. The results showed that the electro\342\200\220catalytic degradation of Terramycin occurred by an \302\267OH radical mechanism. More importantly, this as\342\200\220prepared cathode was very stable and could be reused without any catalytic activity decrease, suggesting its potential application in the wastewater treatment",
