	"abstract": "We discuss the experimental verification of changes in the structure of a liquid water sample inserted in a special spiral \342\200\234gradient\342\200\235 magnetic field. The magnetic flux components are characterized by a high degree of inhomogeneity; thus, a gradient is found in the monitored section of space. The relevant measurement of the modified, rearranged water sample pointed to a specific ion conductivity lower than that of the untreated water. The results of the experiment, where a sample of demineralized water was exposed to a spiral \342\200\234gradient\342\200\234 magnetic field for the period of 5 min, show decreased ion conductivity in the examined samples",
