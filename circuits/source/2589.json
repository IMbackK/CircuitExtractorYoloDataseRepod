	"abstract": "Laser surface modi\357\254\201cation of Ti\342\200\2236Al\342\200\2234V with\n\nan existing calcium phosphate coating has been conducted\n\nto enhance the surface properties. The electrochemical and\n\nmechanical behaviors of calcium phosphate deposited on a\n\nTi\342\200\2236Al\342\200\2234V surface and remelted using a Nd:YAG laser at\n\nvarying laser power densities (25\342\200\22350 W/mm\n\n2\n\n) have been\n\nstudied and the results are presented. The electrochemical\n\nproperties of the modi\357\254\201ed surfaces in Ringer\342\200\231s physiolog-\n\nical solution were evaluated by employing both potentio-\n\ndynamic   polarization   and   electrochemical   impedance\n\nspectroscopy (EIS) methods. The potentiodynamic polar-\n\nizations showed an increase in the passive current density\n\nof Ti\342\200\2236Al\342\200\2234V after laser modi\357\254\201cation at power densities\n\nup  to  35 W/mm\n\n2\n\n,  after  which  it  exhibited  a  decrease.\n\nA reduction in the passive current density (by more than an\n\norder) was observed with an increase in the laser power\n\ndensity  from  25  to  50 W/mm\n\n2\n\n.  EIS  studies  at  the  open\n\ncircuit potential (OCP) and in the passive region at 1.19 V\n\nshowed  that  the  polarization  resistance  increased  from\n\n8.274 9 10\n\n3\n\nto  4.38 9 10\n\n5\n\nX cm\n\n2\n\nwith  increasing  laser\n\npower  densities.  However,  the  magnitudes  remain  lower\n\nthan that of the untreated Ti\342\200\2236Al\342\200\2234V at OCP. The average\n\nhardness  and  modulus  of  the  laser  treated  Ti\342\200\2236Al\342\200\2234V,\n\nevaluated  by  the  nanoindentation  method,  were  deter-\n\nmined  to  be  5.4\342\200\2236.5 GPa  (with  scatter  \\\302\2610.976 GPa)\n\nand  124\342\200\223155 GPa  (with  scatter \\\302\26113 GPa)  respectively.\n\nThe  corresponding  hardness  and  modulus  of  untreated\n\nTi\342\200\2236Al\342\200\2234V were *4.1 (\302\2610.62) and *148 (\302\2617) GPa respec-\n\ntively.  Laser  processing  at  power  densities [35 W/mm\n\n2 enhanced the surface properties (as passive current density is reduced) so that the materials may be suitable for the bio-medical applications",
