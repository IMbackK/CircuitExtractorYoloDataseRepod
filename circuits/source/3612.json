	"abstract": "Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) for lithium ion insertion and deinsertion in spinel LiMn2O4 were obtained at different potentials and different temperatures during initial charge-discharge cycle. The results revealed that, at intermediate degrees of intercalation, three semicircles appeared in the Nyquist diagram. This new phenomenon has been investigated through EIS measurements as a function of temperature. It has found that the high frequency semicircle and the middle to high frequency semicircle begin to overlap each other above 20 degrees C, which indicates that the high frequency compressed semicircle commonly obtained at room temperature in the literature may consist of two semicircles. This signifies that the effects of the electronic and ionic transport properties of lithium intercalation materials clearly appear as separate features in the EIS spectra at low temperatures. A new equivalent circuit that includes elements related to the electronic and ionic transport, in addition to the charge transfer process, is proposed to simulate the experimental EIS data. The change of kinetic parameters for lithium ion insertion and deinsertion in spinel LiMn2O4 as a function of potential in the first charge-discharge cycle is discussed in detail, and a modified model is proposed to explain the impedance response of the insertion materials for lithium ion batteries.National Basic Research Program of China [2009CB220102",
