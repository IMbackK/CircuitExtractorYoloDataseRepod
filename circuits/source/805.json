	"abstract": "This chapter will focus on the use of electropolymerization schemes and reactions to modify electrode surfaces with organo- and organometallic compounds such as metal(II)-4, 9, 16, 23-tetraminophthalocyanines and metal complexes of 5-amino-1, 10-phenanthroline. The chemical modification described herein focuses on the formation of polymer films on electrode surfaces. In addition, the characterization of such films using cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry, chronocoulometry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy will be a key emphasis within this chapter. A brief review of the literature concerning these techniques along with relevant compounds that have been used in studies related to these voltammetric techniques is presented",
