	"abstract": "This paper proposes the design of a biosensor to characterize the dielectric and conductive properties of\r\nbiological materials (for example blood or water) by impedance spectroscopy. Particularly, its design optimized\r\nthe geometric structure interdigitated electrodes. This optimization allows extending the frequency\r\nrange of measurement by reducing the polarization effect. Polarization effect is manifested by an interface\r\ncapability (or double layer) from interaction between ions and molecules in the boundary between the surface\r\nof the electrolyte and the electrodes, it increases the measurement error at low frequencies. This paper\r\nrecommends also a novel method to determine the parameters (relative permittivity, thickness and capacitance\r\nper unit area) of the double layer (DL) at the contact surface of the electrode with the solution.\r\nCoventorWare software was utilized to modelize of interdigital sensor structure in three dimensions (3D)\r\nto verify the analytical results and evaluate the influence of geometrical parameters and the dielectric\r\nproperties of the medium on bioelectrical impedance.\nWhen you are citing the document, use the following link http://essuir.sumdu.edu.ua/handle/123456789/3443",
