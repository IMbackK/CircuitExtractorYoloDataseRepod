	"abstract": "Point-of-care biosensor applications require low-cost and low-power solutions. They offer being easily accessible at home site. They are usable without any complex sample handling or any kind of special expertise. Impedance spectroscopy has been utilized for point-of-care biosensor applications; however, electrical double layer formed due to ions in the solution of interest has been a challenge, due to shielding of the electric field used for sensing the target molecules. Here in this study, we demonstrate a nanogap based biosensor structure with a relatively low frequency (1\342\200\223100\302\240kHz) measurement technique, which not only eliminates the undesired shielding effect of electrical double layer but also helps in minimizing the measurement volume and enabling low concentration (\302\265 molar level) detection of target molecules (streptavidin). Repeatability and sensitivity tests proved stable and reliable operation of the sensors. These biosensors might offer attributes such as low-cost label-free detection, fast measurement and monolithic chip integrability. \302\251 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg",
