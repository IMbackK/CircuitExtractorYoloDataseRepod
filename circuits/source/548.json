	"abstract": "This study investigates a novel method of undertaking online electrochemical impedance spectroscopy\nmeasurements to estimate battery impedance across the frequency range using a battery balancing circuit. A switched\ncapacitor balancing system is used to generate an excitation signal of low-frequency of variable values from which battery\nvoltage and current can be measured to estimate the impedance",
