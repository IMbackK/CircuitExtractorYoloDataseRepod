	"abstract": "Organoclay nanogold composite were prepared using gold nanoparticles and the natural Cameroonian clay grafted with amino organosilane. The functionnalization of clay provided abundant amino group to assemble gold nanoparticles. A label-free electrochemical immunosensor for the sensitive determination of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was fabricated by immobilizing anti-CEA onto organoclay nanogold composite film modified electrode by the cross-linking method using glutaraldehyde. In addition, the preparation procedure of the immunosensor was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Under optimal conditions, the resulting immunosensor displayed a high sensitivity for the detection of CEA, and responded to the CEA concentration in two ranges from 0.05 to 5.0 ng/mL (R = 0.991) and from 5.0 to 120.0 ng/mL (R = 0.998) with a detection limit of 0.01 ng/mL",
