	"abstract": "In the search for bio and eco\342\200\220friendly light sources, light\342\200\220emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) are promising candidates for the implementation of biomaterials in their device architecture thanks to their low fabrication complexity and wide range of potential technological applications. In this work, the use of the DNA derivative DNA\342\200\220cetyltrimethylammonium (DNA\342\200\220CTMA) is introduced as the ion\342\200\220solvating component of the solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) in the active layer of solution\342\200\220processed LECs. The focus is particularly on the investigation of its electrochemical and ionic conductivity properties demonstrating its suitability for device fabrication and correlation with thin film morphology. Furthermore, upon blending with the commercially available emissive polymer Super Yellow, the structure property relationship between the microstructure and the ionic conductivity is investigated and yields an optimized LEC performance. The large electrochemical stability window of DNA\342\200\220CTMA enables a stable device performance for a variety of emitters covering the complete visible spectral range, thus highlighting the universal character of this naturally sourced SPE",
