	"abstract": "The quest for sustainable and more efficient energy-converting devices has been the focus of researchers\342\200\262 efforts in the past decades. In this study, SiO2 nanofiber mats were fabricated through an electrospinning process and later functionalized using silane chemistry to introduce different polar groups -OH (neutral), -SO3H (acidic) and -NH2 (basic). The modified nanofiber mats were embedded in PBI to fabricate mixed matrix membranes. The incorporation of these nanofiber mats in the PBI matrix showed an improvement in the chemical and thermal stability of the composite membranes. Proton conduction measurements show that PBI composite membranes containing nanofiber mats with basic groups showed higher proton conductivities, reaching values as high as 4 mS\302\267cm\342\210\2221 at 200 \302\272C",
