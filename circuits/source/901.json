	"abstract": "Vertically-aligned arrays of single walled carbon nanotubes were created on an optically transparent electrode (FTO glass) these arrays were found to exhibit a prompt current and voltage when exposed to light. These cells were then investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and found to exhibit a dampening of the recombination reaction over the first 24 hours. Symmetrical cell modeling was successful in simulating the behavior of normal cell architecture",
