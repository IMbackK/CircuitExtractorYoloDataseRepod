	"abstract": "We investigate the ion gel gating of 2D colloidal nanoplatelets. We propose a simple, versatile, and air-operable strategy to build electrolyte-gated transistors. We provide evidence that the charges are injected in the quantum states of the nanocrystals. The gating is made possible by the presence of large voids into the NPL films and is sensitive to the availability of the nanocrystals surface",
