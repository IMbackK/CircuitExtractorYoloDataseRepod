	"abstract": "The core objective of EMPIR project 17RPT04 VersICaL is to improve the European measurement infrastructure for electrical impedance, with particular emphasis on the capabilities of developing NMIs and calibration centres. The project will seek to exploit the results of existing research on digital impedance bridges (DIBs) by designing, constructing and validating simple, affordable versions suitable to realise the impedance scale in the range 1 nF to 10 \316\274F and 1 mH to 10 H with relative uncertainties in the range 10-5 to 10-6. The first results of the research project, including the bridge designs and details of a polyphase digitally synthesized multichannel source capable of providing voltage outputs of precise ratio and phase are presented",
