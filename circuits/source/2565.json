	"abstract": "Peculiarities of kinetic characteristics in a supramolecular system, in particular, in a double\342\200\220matrix structure observed at change of the guest content in a matrix\342\200\220host are investigated. Results obtained within the framework of a time\342\200\220independent one\342\200\220dimensional Schro\314\210dinger equation with three barrier potential qualitatively explain experimental data. They indicate the importance of size quantization of a system, correlation between energy and geometric characteristics of both guest and host in this case",
