	"abstract": "This paper presents a new technique for investigating the modifications induced by highdensity green light [GL] on water in NaCl solutions. Solutions of 0,45 g% and 0,9 g%, irradiated with green light (\316\273=527 nm, intensity 3\302\26710 5 Lx) were used. As a receptor for measuring the irradiation effect we used red blood cell (RBC) permeability in hypotonic media, the so-called osmotic shock. After RBC lysis in hypotonic medium, the released hemoglobin was spectrophotometrically determined at \316\273=550 nm. The values of the osmotic shock for the samples obtained with GL-irradiated NaCl solutions were significantly lower than the values obtained with non-irradiated controls. This may indicate that the penetration of water inside the membranes canaliculi is hindered. This new type of result was complemented by chronoamperometry and impedance spectroscopy determinations. The current density of the irradiated solution decreases from the value of 29.5 \302\265A\302\267cm -2 in the control to 17.74 \302\265A\302\267cm -2 in the irradiated sample with a corresponding decrease of ionic mobility. The impedance value of the GL irradiated NaCl solutions were significantly lower than the control values, thus correlating well with the data recorded by chronoamperometry. All these data may indicate large water cluster formation through GL irradiation which are beyond the cellular aquaporine channels capacity. A similar process is identified by using red light, as well as blue light, though with a much smaller output",
