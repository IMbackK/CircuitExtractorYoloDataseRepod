	"abstract": "International audienceGlass composition 25Li2O\342\200\22350V2O5\342\200\22325P2O5 has been investigated as a potential material for electrode. Electrical properties as well as electrochemical performances of this glass composition have been characterized and results show a capacity less than 80mAhg\342\210\2221 when tested in the [3\342\200\2234.5V] potential window. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first lithiated amorphous material reported as a potential positive electrode material. Glasses, due to their wide available compositions in a given system and their easy processing, pave the way to new type of electrode material",
