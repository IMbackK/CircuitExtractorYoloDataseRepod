	"abstract": "Pulsed laser deposition technique is one of the methods to coat the hydroxyapatite on 316L stainless steel and Ti\342\200\2236Al\342\200\2234V implants, which is used in orthopaedics and dentistry applications. In this study, hydroxyapatite (HAP) ceramics in the form of calcium phosphate were deposited on Ti\342\200\2236Al\342\200\2234V and 316L stainless steel by the pulsed laser deposition method. The coated thin film was characterised by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and atomic microscopy. The corrosion studies were carried out on coated and uncoated samples using potentiodynamic polarisation studies in simulated body fluid (Hanks\342\200\231 solution). The bioactivity of the Hap-coated samples on Ti\342\200\2236Al\342\200\2234V and 316L stainless steel was evaluated by immersing them in simulated body fluid for 9 days. XRD and EDS analyses confirmed the presence of HAP. The corrosion studies showed that the treated samples have better corrosion resistance compared to Ti\342\200\2236Al\342\200\2234V and 316L stainless-steel substrates. The formation of apatite on treated samples revealed the bioactivity of the HAP-coated substrates. HAP-coated Ti\342\200\2236Al\342\200\2234V provides higher corrosion protection than the HAP-coated 316L stainless-steel substrates",
