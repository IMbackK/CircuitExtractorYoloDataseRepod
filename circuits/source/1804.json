Wax and starch were used as natural, green adhesives for enhancing the electrical resistivity of lignin in acidic medium, forming eco-friendly high insulator biocomposite. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to characterize the fabricated biocomposite. The modified lignin was characterized using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), while the electrochemical behavior was examined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The innovative approach described in this work provides a promising eco- friendly method for lignin modification with highly electrical resistivity and stability with time.\303\202",
