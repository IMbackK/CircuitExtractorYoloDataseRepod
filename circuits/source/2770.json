	"abstract": "In the present work, Ag nanoparticles were added to polyurea coating in order to improve its antibacterial and electrochemical properties in sulfide-reducing bacteria-containing media. To this end, Ag nano-powder was mixed with two component polyuria, and then the antibacterial behavior of the nanocomposite coating was studied in sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB)-containing medium. The results revealed the inhibitory effects of nanocomposite coating on the formation of SRB biofilms on the samples. Moreover, the SRB population decreased in contact with the Ag nanoparticles-mixed coating over 7 days. Investigation of the growth and activity of the bacteria represented the effective antibacterial properties of Ag nanoparticles in the polyurea matrix. Furthermore, EIS (electrochemical impedance spectroscopy) measurements indicated that the corrosion properties of the nanocomposite coating improved considerably over 7 days. The coating resistance increased 2 times by adding Ag nanoparticles after 1 day and 3.3 times after 7 days. In accordance with the same results, the charge transfer resistance increased 1.5 times and 1.1 times by adding Ag nanoparticles after 1 day and 7 days, respectively. The improvement in the protective properties of the nanocomposite coating are reflected in the increase in both film and charge transfer resistance",
