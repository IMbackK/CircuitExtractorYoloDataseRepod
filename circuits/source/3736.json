	"abstract": "This chapter analyzes the experimental data using impedance spectroscopy to reduce water pollution by nitrate ions. The adsorption is through a synthesized layered double hydroxide (Zn3-Al-Cl-LDH). The kinetic study data analysis by pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order models is highly correlated they were found to fit very well the pseudo-second-order. This is confirmed by fast kinetic modeling of experimental data according to the pseudo-second-order. Furthermore, the Nyquist plots suggest that the grains and grain boundaries have contributed to the conduction mechanism of the material at different adsorption times and monitoring of the adsorption phenomenon. The investigation by impedance spectroscopy was used for modeling by an equivalent circuit. The real and imaginary functions of impedance complex are analyzed by modifying Cole-Cole relaxation. Revel most changes in the structure of the manifestation of the grains and the grains boundaries. The alternative current (AC) conductivity was investigated using the double power law of Jonscher. More importantly, the calculated value and the percentage of efficiency are evaluated in the adsorption. The water molecules and nitrate ions in the adsorbed were favored for the generation of the electrical response. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy data are often interpreted by using electrical equivalent circuits",
