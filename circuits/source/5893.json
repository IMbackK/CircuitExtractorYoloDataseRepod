	"abstract": "Merging of electronics with biology, defined as bioelectronics, at the nanoscale holds considerable promise for sensing and modulating cellular behavior. Advancing our understanding of nanobioelectronics will facilitate development and enable applications in biosensing, tissue engineering, and bioelectronic medicine. However, studies investigating the electrical effects when merging wireless conductive nanoelectrodes with biology are lacking. Consequently, a tool is required to develop a greater understanding of merging conductive nanoparticles with cells. Herein, this challenge is addressed by developing an impedimetric method to evaluate bipolar electrode (BPE) systems that could report on electrical input. A theoretical framework is provided, using impedance to determine if conductive nanoparticles can be polarized and used to drive current. It is then demonstrated that 125 nm of gold nanoparticle (AuNP) bipolar electrodes (BPEs) could be sensed in the presence of cells when incorporated intracellularly at 500 \316\274g/mL using water and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as electrolytes. These results highlight how nanoscale BPEs act within biological systems. This research will impact the rational design of using BPE systems in cells for both sensing and actuating applications",
