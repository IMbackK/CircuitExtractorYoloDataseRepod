	"abstract": "An important role of the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is the characterization of the electrical double layer formed at the electrode/electrolyte interfaces. The phenomenological double layer studies with an aqueous and ionic liquid electrolytes are reviewed with a conclusion that the double layer capacitance is frequency dependent as the rule rather than the exception. We discuss the impedance consequences of the nonuniform current distribution along the electrochemical interface, which also contributes to the apparent frequency dependence of the capacitance. Finally we show recent articles on nonconventional EIS techniques with high lateral resolution or enabling fast measurements",
