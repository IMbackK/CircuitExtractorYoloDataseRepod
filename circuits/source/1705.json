	"abstract": "An efficient, industry-accepted spray drying method was used to synthesize microspherical\r\nsulfur/graphene oxide (S/GO) composites as cathode materials within lithium sulfur\r\nbatteries. The as-designed wrapping of the sulfur-nanoparticles, with wrinkled GO composites,\r\nwas characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy\r\n(TEM). The unique morphological design of this material enabled superior discharge capacity and\r\ncycling performance, demonstrating a high initial discharge capacity of 1400 mAh g1 at 0.1 C.\r\nThe discharge capacity remained at 828 mAh g1 after 150 cycles. The superior electrochemical\r\nperformance indicates that the S/GO composite improves electrical conductivity and alleviates the\r\nshuttle effect. This study represents the first time such a facile spray drying method has been adopted\r\nfor lithium sulfur batteries and used in the fabrication of S/GO composite",
