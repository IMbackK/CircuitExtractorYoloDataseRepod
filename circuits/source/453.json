	"abstract": "Amplitudes and shapes of extracellular recordings from single neurons cultured on a substrate embedded microelectrode depend not only on the volume conducting properties of the neuron-electrode interface, but might also depend on the distribution of voltage-sensitive channels over the neuronal membrane. In this paper, finite-element modeling is used to quantify the effect of these channel distributions on the neuron-electrode contact. Slight accumulation or depletion of voltage-sensitive channels in the sealing membrane of the neuron results in various shapes and amplitudes of simulated extracellular recordings. However, estimation of channel-specific accumulation factors from extracellular recordings can be obstructed by co-occuring ion currents and defect sealing. Experimental data from cultured neuron-electrode interfaces suggest depletion of sodium channels and accumulation of potassium channels",
