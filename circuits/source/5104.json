	"abstract": "Silicon (Si)-based material is a promising anode material for next-generation lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Herein, we report the fabrication of a silicon oxide\342\200\223carbon (SiO_x/C) nanocomposite through the reaction between silicon particles with fresh surface and H\342\202\202O in a mild hydrothermal condition, as well as conducting carbon coating synchronously. We found that controllable oxidation could be realized for Si particles to produce uniform SiO_x after the removal of the native passivation layer. The uniform oxidation and conductive coating offered the as-fabricated SiO_x/C composite good stability at both particle and electrode level over electrochemical cycling. The as-fabricated SiO_x/C composite delivered a high reversible capacity of 1133 mAh g\342\201\273\302\271 at 0.5 A g\342\201\273\302\271 with 89.1% capacity retention after 200 cycles. With 15 wt % SiO-x/C composite, graphite-SiO_x/C hybrid electrode displayed a high reversible specific capacity of 496 mAh g\342\201\273\302\271 and stable electrochemical cycling with a capacity retention of 90.1% for 100 cycles",
