	"abstract": "The main purpose of the research was to analyze the influence of surface modification of the cobalt-based alloy used in dental prosthetics by applying zirconium oxide (ZrO2) layers using the ALD (Atomic Layer Deposition) method. The samples were made using the DMLS (Direct Metal Laser Sintering) technique, and their surfaces were prepared in accordance with the principles of removable partial dentures (RPDs). A 50 nm-thick zirconium oxide coating was applied to the prepared substrates. This paper deals with the issues of prosthetic stomatopathy, which is a complex of pathological changes occurring in approx. 40% of the Polish population using removable dentures. Often, these changes, occurring on the mucosa, are related to improper performance, allergic reactions or the multiplication of bacteria on the surface of partial dentures. An innovative method of surface modification was proposed, together with the analysis of its influence on the physicochemical properties of the alloy and the adhesion of bacteria to the surface",
