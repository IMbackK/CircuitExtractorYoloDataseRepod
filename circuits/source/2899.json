	"abstract": "New polymer electrolytes (PEs), potentially interesting for solid-state\r\nelectrochemical devices applications, were synthesized by a solvent casting method\r\nusing pectin and ionic liquid (IL) N,N,N-trimethyl-N-(2-hydroxyethyl)ammonium\r\nbis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([N1 1 1 2(OH)][NTf2]. The resulting electrolytes besides\r\nbeing moderately homogenous and thermally stable below 155 \302\272C, they also\r\nexhibited good mechanical properties. The SPE membranes were analyzed by\r\ndifferential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron\r\nmicroscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and complex impedance\r\nspectroscopy.This work was supported by FEDER through the COMPETE Program and by\r\nFunda\303\247\303\243o para a Ci\303\252ncia e a Tecnologia (FCT) in the framework of the Strategic\r\nProjects PEST-C/QUI/UI0686/2013, grants FCT Investigator contract (J.M.S.S.E.).
