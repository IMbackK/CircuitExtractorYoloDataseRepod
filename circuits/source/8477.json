	"abstract": "Binary Zr-Ti alloys spontaneously develop a tenacious and compact oxide layer when\r\ntheir fresh surface is exposed either to air or to aqueous environments. Electrochemical impedance\r\nspectroscopy (EIS) analysis of Zr-45Ti, Zr-25Ti, and Zr-5Ti exposed to simulated physiological\r\nsolutions at 37  C evidences the formation of a non-sealing bilayer oxide film that accounts for the\r\ncorrosion resistance of the materials. Unfortunately, these oxide layers may undergo breakdown\r\nand stable pitting corrosion regimes at anodic potentials within the range of those experienced\r\nin the human body under stress and surgical conditions. Improved corrosion resistance has been\r\nachieved by prior treatment of these alloys using thermal oxidation in air. EIS was employed to\r\nmeasure the corrosion resistance of the Zr-Ti alloys in simulated physiological solutions of a wide\r\npH range (namely 3   pH   8) at 37  C, and the best results were obtained for the alloys pre-treated\r\nat 500  C. The formation of the passivating oxide layers in simulated physiological solution was\r\nmonitored in situ using scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM), finding a transition from an\r\nelectrochemically active surface, characteristic of the bare metal, to the heterogeneous formation of\r\noxide layers behaving as insulating surfaces towards electron transfer reactions",
