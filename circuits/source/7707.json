	"abstract": "A La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3\342\210\222\316\264-Ce0.8Gd0.18Ca0.02O2\342\210\222\316\264 composite cathode was used to investigate the electrochemical synthesis of ammonia from wet nitrogen. Wet nitrogen was flown through a dual chamber reactor under atmospheric pressure leading to the successful synthesis of ammonia. Ammonia was synthesised at a rate of 1.5 \303\227 10\342\210\22210 mol s\342\210\2221 cm\342\210\2222 at 400 \302\260C when applying a dc voltage of 1.4 V, which is the highest reported to date. This rate is twice that of the observed ammonia formation rate (7 \303\227 10\342\210\22211 mol s\342\210\2221 cm\342\210\2222) when Co-free cathode, La0.6Sr0.4FeO3\342\210\222\316\264-Ce0.8Gd0.18Ca0.02O2\342\210\222\316\264 was used as the cathode catalyst. A higher catalytic activity for ammonia synthesis may be obtained when using a catalyst with high oxygen vacancies, with the introduction of oxygen vacancies at the cathode being a good strategy to improve the catalytic activity of ammonia synthesis",
