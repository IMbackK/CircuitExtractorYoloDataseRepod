	"abstract": "Rechargeable Li-ion battery technology has progressed due to the development of a suitable combination of electroactive materials, binders, electrolytes, additives, and electrochemical cycling protocols that resulted in the formation of a stable electrode-electrolyte interphase. It is expected that Na-ion technology will attain a position comparable to Li-ion batteries dependent on advancements in establishing a stable electrode-electrolyte interphase. However, Li and Na are both alkali metals with similar characteristics, yet the physicochemical properties of these systems differ. For this reason, a detailed study on the electrode-electrolyte interphase properties, composition, and structure is required to understand the factors that influence the battery\\u27s behavior. Herein, the research that has been performed on the electrode-electrolyte interphase for both anode and cathode in the most important families of electrode materials, including carbonate ester-based and advanced electrolytes such as ether-based carbonates and ionic liquids is presented",
