	"abstract": "Electrochemical impedance spectra at 450-600 \302\260C and $${P_{{\\rm{O}}_{\\rm{2}} } = 0.5}$$ kPa of a rhodium catalyst interfaced with yttria-stabilized-zirconia (Rh/YSZ) were compared with a model based on the mechanism of electrochemical promotion. In the proposed equivalent electric circuit, existence of an \"effective\342\200\235 double layer at the gas-exposed catalyst surface and its potential-controlled modification via diffusion of oxygen ions between the O2\342\210\222 conducting solid electrolyte support (YSZ) and the catalyst are represented by two additional elements: adsorption capacitance and Warburg impedance. Under positive polarization, the adsorption capacitance increases dramatically indicating reinforcement of the \"effective\342\200\235 double layer at the catalyst/gas interface, in agreement with the observation known from electrochemical promotion practice that positive polarization of a rhodium electrode leads to rhodium oxide reduction, hence, to dramatic increase in catalytic reaction rat",
