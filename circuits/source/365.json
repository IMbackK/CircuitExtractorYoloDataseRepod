	"abstract": "ELECTROCHEMICALIMPEDANCE SPECTROSCOPY STUDY OF POLYVINYL ALCOHOL SHEETWITHADDITION OFLiClO4AS ELECTROLYTE MATERIAL OF Li-ION BATTERAY. Solid polymer electrolyte materials for Li ion battery have been prepared using polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) added by lithium perchlorate (LiClO4) salt with various concentration. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) study of the material was done by making a Nyquist plot of the measurement with a LCR meter. These electrolyte materials prepared by using PVA powder which was dissolved into distilled water and added LiClO4 salt varied in 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 w/w % . After drying the solution, PVA sheet with various LiClO4 salt as Li ion battery electrolyte material was obtained. Nyquist plots for sheet of PVA with various LiClO4 salt which varied 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 w/w% has been studied using LCR meter. Information of electrolyte resistance, resistance of the film surface and the charge transfer resistance is obtained by modeling the equivalent circuit according to the Nyquist plot. The result shows that the lithium ion diffusion increased with the increasing LiClO4 content in the PVA film",
