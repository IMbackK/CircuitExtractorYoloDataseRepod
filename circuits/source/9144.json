	"abstract": "In this research work, fine powders of spinel-type LiMn2-xNixO4-\316\264 (where x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5) as cathode materials for lithium ion batteries were synthesized by combustion synthesis using urea as fuel and metal nitrates as oxidizers at a temperature of 600\302\260C. The physiochemical properties of the prepared cathode materials were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), particle size analysis, energy dispersive analysis (EDAX) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The electrochemical characteristics were studied by impedance spectroscopy. It was found that the physical charactetertistics were moderately influenced because of different dopant (Ni) concentration. Among the samples studied,\302\240 LiMn1.9Ni0.1O4-\316\264 resulted in better electrical conductivity (6.49 x 10-5 Scm-1) at room temperature and hence it may be suitable for lithium ion battery applications.Keywords:Ni doped LiMn2O4,\302\240 physical characterization, lithium ion battery application",
