	"abstract": "The corrosion behavior of a commercial Pb-1.7% Sb gridof lead-acid batteries under open circuit conditions in 5M H\302\2402SO4 in the presence of phosphoric acid is studiedby electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclicvoltammetry. Dependence of corrodibility of the alloy onH\302\2403PO4 concentration is weak up to 0.7M. After days ofcorrosion, the corrosion rate in the presence of H\302\2403PO4 isslightly higher than in its absence, due to retardation of the growth of an insulating PbSO\302\2404 layer that acts as an effective diffusion barrier of the corrosive species. The electronic and diffusion properties of the passive layer formed in the presence of H\302\2403PO4 are substantially inferior. Cyclic voltammetry indicates a decrease in amounts of PbSO\302\2404 and Sb\302\2402O3 formed in the presence of H3PO4 and with increasing its concentration. Also, the amount of PbO formed beneath the PbSO\302\2404 layer increases with increasing H3PO4 concentration on the expense of the amount of PbSO\302\2404",
