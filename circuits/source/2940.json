	"abstract": "Hydrothermal growth of ZnO nanowires has been of great interest as it allows the use of organic substrates for flexible electronics applications. However, there are drawbacks on the growth technique as it is known to introduce defects in the nanowires. In this work, the use of intense pulsed light on hydrothermally grown ZnO nanowires on polyimide substrate was performed to enhance the physical and electronic properties of the nanomaterials. Such photonic annealing technique offers a rapid and effective improvement in material properties and importantly it is suitable for use on a wide variety of organic substrates, which are vital for flexible electronics",
