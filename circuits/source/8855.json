	"abstract": "An advanced lithium ion battery using nanostructured tinecarbon lithium alloying anode and a high voltage LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 spinel-type cathode is studied, with particular focus to the low temperature range. The stable behavior of the battery is assured by the use of an electrolyte media based on a LiPF6 salt dissolved in EC-DEC-DMC, i.e. a mixture particularly suitable for the low temperature application. Cycling tests, both in half cells and in full lithium ion battery using the SneC anode and the LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 cathode, performed in a temperature range extending from room temperature to \"30 C, indicate that the electrode/electrolyte configuration here adopted may be suitable for effective application in the lithium ion battery field. The full cell, cycled at -5 \302\260C, shows stable capacity of about 105 mAh g-1 over more than 200 chargee-discharge cycles that is considered a relevant performance considering the low temperature region",
