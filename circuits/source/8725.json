	"abstract": "Abstract The dental ceramic materials are constantly being developed due to their continuous clinical appli- cation in the eld of esthetic dentistry. Glass ceramics (GC) materials are also of special interest for dental application due to their speci c properties ; and thus, they can be applied as crowns, veneers and small bridges. Purpose: However, due to a variety of different GC materials, it is of keen inter- est to inspect their morphology and ion-diffusion, which also governs aging properties. Material and methods: In this study, two different GC materials were processed, i.e., lithium silicate (LS-10) and lithium disilicate (LS-20). The aforementioned properties can be inspected by using impedance spec- troscopy (IS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results: SEM study suggested that LS-10 ma- terial is harder to mechanically process by computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) technology. Furthermore, IS measurements showed that LS-20 (vs. LS-10) has more pro- nounced resistance properties. Conclusion: According to IS data, it was concluded that LS-20 (vs. LS- 10) has more pronounced resistance properties that point out to hindered ion- diffusion and to bet- ter aging properties",
