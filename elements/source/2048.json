	"abstract": "Functional assays of membrane proteins are becoming increasingly important, both in research and drug discovery applications. The majority of current assays use the patch-clamp technology to measure the activity of ion channels which are over-expressed in cells. In future, in vitro assay systems will be available, which use reconstituted membrane proteins in free-standing lipid bilayers suspended in nano- or micrometer-sized pores. Such functional assays require (1) expression, purification and reconstitution of the membrane protein of interest, (2) a reliable method for lipid bilayer formation and membrane protein integration, and (3) a sensitive detection system. For practical applications, especially for automation, the reliable and controllable transport of fluids is essential. In order to achieve a stable free-standing lipid bilayer, a pore diameter in the micro- to nanometer range is essential. Novel microfluidic devices were developed by bonding a thick (300\316\274m) polyether ether ketone foil, bearing a channel structure, to a thin (12\316\274m) foil with a micropore of about 10\316\274m diameter and then utilized for the formation of stable, free-standing lipid bilayers within the pore. A bacterial voltage-gated potassium channel is integrated therein by fusion and the ion channel activity detected by voltage clam",
