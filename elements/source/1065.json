	"abstract": "The purpose of this book is to present and discuss the recent methods in corrosion evaluation and protection. The book contains six chapters. The aim of Chapter 1 is to demonstrate that Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy can be a very useful tool to provide a complete evaluation of the corrosion protection properties of electro-coatings. Chapter 2 presents results of studies of materials degradation from experimental electrochemical tests and theoretical calculations. Chapter 3 deals with the presentation of the corrosion and corrosion prevention of the aluminum alloys by organic coatings and inhibitors. Chapter 4 addresses the new method of pigment preparation that can improve protection efficiency. The effectiveness of plasma deposited films on the improvement of carbon steel corrosion resistance is discussed in Chapter 5. Chapter 6 deals with the conjugation of carbon nanotubes with organic-inorganic hybrid to prepare hybrid coatings that combine high anti-corrosion efficiency with elevated mechanical resistance",
