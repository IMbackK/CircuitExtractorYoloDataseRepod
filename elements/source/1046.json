	"abstract": "In the current work, we have explored a novel synthetic route towards metalated porphycenes and their use in p-type NiO-based dye-sensitized solar cells. Particular emphasis is placed on the influence that the relative positioning of the anchoring group exerts on the DSSC performance",
