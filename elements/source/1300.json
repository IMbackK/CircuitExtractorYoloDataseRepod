	"abstract": "Partial financial support from the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) in the frame of the BenchBatt project (reference number 03XP0047B) is gratefully acknowledged.The lack of suitable candidate electrolyte materials for practical application limits development of all-solid-state Na-ion batteries. Na3+xZr2Si2+xP1-xO12 were the very first series of NASICONs discovered some 40 years ago; however, separation of bulk conductivity from total conductivity at room temperature is still problematic. It has been suggested that the effective Na-ion conductivity is ~10-4 S cm-1 at room temperature for Na3+xZr2Si2+xP1-xO12 ceramics; however using solution-assisted solid-state reaction for preparation of Na3+xZr2Si2+xP1-xO12, total conductivity of 5 × 10-3 S cm-1 was achieved for Na3.4Zr2Si2.4P0.6O12 at 25 °C, higher than previously reported for polycrystalline Na-ion conductors. Bulk conductivity of 1.5 × 10-2 S cm-1 was revealed by high frequency impedance spectroscopy (up to 3 GHz) and verified by low temperature impedance spectroscopy (down to -100 °C) for Na3.4Zr2Si2.4P0.6O12 at 25 °C, indicating further potential of increasing the related total conductivity. A Na/Na3.4Zr2Si2.4P0.6O12/Na symmetric cell showed low interface resistance and high cycling stability at room temperature. A full-ceramic cell was fabricated and tested at 28 °C with good cycling performance.PostprintPeer reviewe",
