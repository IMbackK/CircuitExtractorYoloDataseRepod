	"abstract": "Cobalt phosphates with open framework present various physical performances in relation to their structures. In fact, the development of new materials that could potentially be ionic conductors or ion exchangers led us to examine the Co-P-O and A-Co-P-O crystallographic systems (A: monovalent cation) and their different methods of synthesis. This work consists first of all in highlighting the crystalline phases of cobalt phosphates. Indeed, many works related to the discovery of some of these materials with interesting properties, in particular ionic conductivity, motivated our research and encouraged us to collect several cobalt phosphates and to correlate structure-physical properties in particular electrical properties",
