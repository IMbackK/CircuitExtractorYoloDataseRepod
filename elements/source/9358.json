	"abstract": "Zn-Fe compositionally modulated multilayer alloy (CMMA) coatings were developed onto low carbon steel from acid sulphate bath; and their corrosion resistance was calculated using Tafel polarization and impedance methods. The deposit layers were formed galvanostatically by single bath technique (SBT), using square current pulses. An optimal configuration for the growth of most corrosion resistant Zn-Fe coating was proposed and discussed. At maximum switching cathode current density (SCCD) (2.0\342\200\2235.0 A dm\342\210\2222), the deposit with 300 layers showed ~43 times superior corrosion resistance than the same thickness of monolayer coating. The improved corrosion resistance of multilayered coatings is due to small change in iron content, leading to change the phase structure of the alternate-layers of the alloy coatings. The surface morphology and structure of film and roughness of the deposit were assessed using Scanning Electron Microscopy and Atomic Force Microscopy. Thus, superior corrosion resistance of Zn-Fe multilayer coatings was used for industrial applications including defense, machinery and automobile etc",
