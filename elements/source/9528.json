	"abstract": "The recent progress made in the development of electrochemical methods for microRNA (miRNA) detection is\n\npresented. This progress is conceived to be largely due to the invention of novel assay methodologies and the use of various bioreagents and nanostructures. These enable a rigorous control over the sensing interface, provide enormous signal amplifications and single-base mismatch specificity. Femtomolar or even subfemtomolar detection limits were shown to be feasible by electrochemical assays. Thus electrochemical detection methodologies are of perspective for diagnostic miRNA detection",
