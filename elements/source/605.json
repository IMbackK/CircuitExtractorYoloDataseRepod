	"abstract": "We show that BiFeO, that is electrically homogeneous, is a good insulator, and has a low dielectric constant (the properties desired in its applications), can be produced by flash sintering, which is nominally difficult to achieve by conventional and spark plasma sintering processes. The flash-sintered specimens had a uniform microstructure with a nanometric grain size of ~20 nm.Ministerio de Econom\303\255a y Competitividad CTQ2014-52763-C2-1-RJunta de Andaluc\303\255a TEP- 7858Office of Naval Research (USA)  N00014-15-1-250",
