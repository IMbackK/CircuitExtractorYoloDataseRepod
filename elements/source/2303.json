	"abstract": "Sol\342\200\223gel coatings for corrosion protection of metals are a good alternative to toxic chromate treatments. The present work focussed on the incorporation of inorganic fillers in a sol\342\200\223gel coating to improve the barrier properties of the film. Talc-like phyllosilicates obtained by hydrothermal synthesis at 160\302\260C, 260\302\260C and 350\302\260C, called T160, T260 and T350 respectively, were selected as inorganic fillers. The synthetic materials showed talc lamellar structure but, in contrast with natural talc, their smaller size (about 300 nm) and their hydrophilic character allowed easier dispersion of the particles in the sol\342\200\223gel matrix. Electrochemical impedance measurements performed on the sol\342\200\223gel coatings deposited on XC35 carbon steel showed that the incorporation of T260 and T350 at a concentration of 20 g L\342\210\222 1 strongly enhanced the barrier properties of the coating by comparison with the filler-free system. As a consequence, the corrosion protection of the metal substrate was improved",
