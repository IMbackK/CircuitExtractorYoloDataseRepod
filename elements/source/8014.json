	"abstract": "Introduction: This study evaluated the removal of the filling material during endodontic retreatment considering the presence of cracks and the dentin age. Methods and Materials: A total of 20 freshly extracted single-rooted teeth were categorized into the following two groups according to the age of the patients: Group Young (Y; aged 18-30 years) and Group Old (O; aged \342\211\24560 years). Each tooth specimen was scanned by microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) subsequently after endodontic retreatment with the Reciproc instruments (REC). The images were analyzed for differences in the volume of dentin cracks and the presence of the filling material in the middle and apical thirds of the teeth among the groups, according to the dentin age. Results: The micro-CT images showed that after retreatment, there were more cracks in the old root dentin than those in the young root dentin, although the difference was not statistically significant (P&gt;0.05). The greatest reduction in the filling material was achieved when the old root dentin with cracks was retreated when compared with that of the young root dentin with cracks, but the difference was not statistically significant (P&gt;0.05). Conclusion: The dentinal age and the presence of cracks were not found to be relevant factors for the removal of the filling material.Keywords: Dentin; Microcomputed Tomography; Retreatmen",
