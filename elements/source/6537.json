	"abstract": "Electrochemical double-layer capacitor (also called supercapacitor) is an electrochemical energy storage device with a high power density, which could be used in application such as pulse power devices or electric vehicles. The paper describes construction of an electrochemical double-layer capacitor that consists of two electrodes immersed in an electrolyte with a separator between them. One electrode consists of a current collector in contact with the active material, while the other one is a counter electrode. Commercially available activated carbon (AC) material, Composite RuO2 + AC and natural copper sulfides are used as the active electrode material. Characterization has been performed by an electrochemical system fully developed at Technical Faculty in Bor. The system is based on a PC P4, a commercially available ADDA converter and an external interface for analog signal processing. The software platform is LabVIEW 8.2 package and application software is adapted to investigations of the systems containing high capacitances",
