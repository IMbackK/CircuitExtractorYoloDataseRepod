	"abstract": "The effect of the red arecanut seed (RAS) extract on the corrosion of aluminum in 0.5 M hydrochloric acid environment is reported by weight loss, electrochemical (Tafel plot and impedance spectroscopy), scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy studies. The weight loss study indicated that, protection efficiency of the red arecanut seed extract is directly proportional to its concentration and inversely proportional to solution temperature and aluminum contact time in the test solution. Langmuir adsorption isotherm is best fitted model explaining the adsorption of red arecanut seed extract constituents on aluminum surface in 0.5 M HCl system. The&nbsp;results obtained from Tafel curves indicated the mixed inhibition role of red arecanut seed extract. The impedance spectroscopy technique indicated that, red arecanut seed extract reduces the speed of aluminum corrosion by charge transfer process. The scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy images of aluminum specimens clearly give clues about the adsorption of plant constituents on the surface of the aluminum metal",
