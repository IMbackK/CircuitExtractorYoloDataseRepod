	"abstract": "We report on a non-covalent functionalization of\r\ngraphene foam (GF) synthesized via chemical vapour deposition\r\n(CVD). The GF was treated with pyrene carboxylic acid\r\n(PCA) which acted as a source of oxygen and/or hydroxyl\r\ngroups attached to the surface of the graphene foam for its\r\nelectrochemical performance improvement. The modified\r\ngraphene surface enabled a high pseudocapacitive effect on\r\nthe GF. A specific capacitance of 133.3 F g\342\210\2221, power density \342\210\274\r\n145.3 kW kg\342\210\2221 and energy density \342\210\274 4.7 W h kg\342\210\2221 were\r\nachieved based on the functionalized foam in 6 M KOH\r\naqueous electrolyte. The results suggest that non-covalent\r\nfunctionalization might be an effective approach to overcome\r\nthe restacking problem associated with graphene electrodes\r\nand also signify the importance of surface functionalities in\r\ngraphene-based electrode materials.South African Research Chairs Initiative of the Department of Science and Technology (SARCHi-DST), the National Research Foundation (NRF) and University of Pretoria.http://link.springer.com/journal/100082015-09-30hb201",
