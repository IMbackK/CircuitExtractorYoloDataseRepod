	"abstract": "Ceramics-ceramic composites in series (1-x)Li2MoO4-xBaFe12O19 (LMO-BF12, 0.00 \342\211\244 x \342\211\244 0.15) have been cold sintered at 120 \302\260C and their structure and properties characterized. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed that compositions were dual phase and had a dense microstructure. Composites in the xBF12-(1-x)LMO (0.0 \342\211\244 x \342\211\244 0.15) series resonated at MW frequencies (\342\210\2746 GHz) with 5.6\342\211\244\316\265r \342\211\244 5.8 and Qf = 16,000\342\200\22322,000 GHz, despite the black colour of compositions with x > 0. The permeability of the composites was measured in the X band (\342\210\2748 GHz) and showed an increase from 0.94 (x = 0.05) to 1.02 (x = 0.15). Finite element modelling revealed that the volume fraction of BF12 dictates the conductivity of the material, with a percolation threshold at 10 vol% BF12 but changes in \316\265r as a function of x were readily explained using a series mixing model. In summary, these composites are considered suitable for the fabrication of dual mode or enhanced bandwidth microstrip patch antennas",
