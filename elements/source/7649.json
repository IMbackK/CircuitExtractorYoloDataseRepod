	"abstract": "\302\251 2017 Elsevier B.V. Device disposability is a critical feature of electrochemical sensor production, allowing complex measurements to be carried out in a low cost and efficient manner. Disposable sensors are increasing rapidly in their level of sophistication, supported by developments in materials and fabrication processing. This is, in turn, leading to greater levels of device integration and functionality and has the potential to significantly expand the number of people who can use them, where they can be deployed and how they can be used. As well as becoming more complex, there is also significant emphasis in making such disposable devices more environmentally sustainable. Current themes in the development of disposable sensors are explored here",
