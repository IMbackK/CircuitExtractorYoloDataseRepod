	"abstract": "Titanium films have been deposited on stainless steel metal sheets using dc magnetron sputtering technique at different substrate temperatures. The structure of the titanium films strongly depend on the substrate temperature. The titanium film deposited at the substrate temperature lower than 300 \302\272C has a loose flat sheet grains structure and the titanium film prepared at the substrate temperature higher than 500 \302\272C has a dense nubby grains structure. The DSSC assembled using stainless steel sheet coated with titanium film deposited at high substrate temperature has a low charge transfer resistance in the TiO2/Ti interface and results in a high conversion efficiency. The DSSC assembled using stainless steel sheet coated with titanium film deposited at temperature higher than 500 \302\272C has higher conversion efficiency than that assembled using titanium metal sheet as the substrate. The maximum conversion efficiency, 2.26% is obtained for DSSC assembled using stainless steel sheet coated with titanium film deposited at 700 \302\272C substrate temperature, which is about 70% of the conversion efficiency of the FTO reference cell used in this study.This work was supported by the Dalian University of Technology through the program of the Sea-sky Scholar",
