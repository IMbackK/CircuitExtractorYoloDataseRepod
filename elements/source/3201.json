	"abstract": "Silanes are an interesting alternative to chromate-based surface treatments for temporary protection of electrogalvanized steel. In this work, the protective behavior of 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane (MTMO), 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (AMEO), or 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GLYMO) ﬁlms applied on electrogalvanized automotive quality steel sheets has been studied. The silane coating morphology, composition, and porosity were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energydispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS), x-ray ﬂuorescence, immersion in copper sulfate, and cyclic voltammetry. The corrosion protection was evaluated by polarization curves, electrochemical noise measurements, electrochemical impedance spectrometry, and accelerated humidity chamber tests. The results showed that the silanes protect temporarily electrogalvanized steel from corrosion. MTMO forms a relatively thick and cracked ﬁlm. AMEO and GLYMO ﬁlms were so thin that they could not be observed by SEM but silicon was detected by EDS. MTMO provided good temporary protection, being an alternative to replace Cr(VI) as protector of electrogalvanized steel.Centro de Investigación y Desarrollo en Tecnología de Pintura",
