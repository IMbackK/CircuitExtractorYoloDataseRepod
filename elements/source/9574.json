	"abstract": "The present study explores the in vitro and in vivo responses of new multifunctional\r\nquaternary beta-type TiMoZrTa alloys designed for biomedical implantation. The\r\nelectrochemical resistance to corrosion of the alloys was investigated in vitro, using linear\r\npotentiodynamic polarization (LPP) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests\r\nin acidified physiological saline solution at 37 oC. The pH was adjusted to 4.0 by adding lactic\r\nacid in order to simulate the hypoxia stress condition that may occur in the healing process of\r\nfractures. The biomaterial alloys spontaneously formed a passivation oxide film on their\r\nsurfaces, which remained stable for polarizations up to +1.0 VSCE, and became more resistant\r\nwith the increased amount of Ta in the alloy composition. The animal tests of the quaternary\r\nTi-20Mo-7Zr-xTa alloys showed adequate biocompatibility as a tibial implant. Among them,\r\nthe 15% Ta-alloy implant showed the best osseointegration according to the results of the\r\nbiochemical, histological and computed tomography characterizations, and can be considered\r\nas a potential biomaterial with low elastic modulus (43.6 GPa)",
