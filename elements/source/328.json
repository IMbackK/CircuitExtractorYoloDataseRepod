	"abstract": "Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy clearly appeared as a suitable technique to investigate the releasing properties of cerium (III) loaded on silica and boehmite nanocontainers. In this way the electrochemical behavior of the AA2024-T3 was evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in a 0.045\303\242\342\202\254\302\257mol\303\242\342\202\254\302\257L\303\242\313\206\342\200\2311 NaCl solution with nanocontainers containing the inhibitor. Results show that the inhibitor release is influenced by both the chemical nature and the morphology of the nanocontainers. The lower loading and release phenomena were observed for the mesoporous silica nanocontainers, whereas the inhibitor is liberated until 168\303\242\342\202\254\302\257h from dense silica nanocontainers. Boehmite nanocontainers combine a good loading ratio with a longer release until the second week of immersion",
