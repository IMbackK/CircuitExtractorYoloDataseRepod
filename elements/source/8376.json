	"abstract": "In recent years, molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) have become an excellent solution to the selective and sensitive determination of target molecules in complex matrices where other similar and relative structural compounds could coexist. Although MIPs show the inherent properties of the polymers, including stability, robustness, and easy/cheap synthesis, some of their characteristics can be enhanced, or new functionalities can be obtained when nanoparticles are incorporated in their polymeric structure. The great variety of nanoparticles available significantly increase the possibility of finding the adequate design of nanostructured MIP for each analytical problem. Moreover, different structures (i.e., monolithic solids or MIPs micro/nanoparticles) can be produced depending on the used synthesis approach. This review aims to summarize and describe the most recent and innovative strategies since 2015, based on the combination of MIPs with nanoparticles. The role of the nanoparticles in the polymerization, as well as in the imprinting and adsorption efficiency, is also discussed through the review",
