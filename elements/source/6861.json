	"abstract": "Alkali-activated materials are an emerging technology that can serve as an alternative solution to ordinary Portland cement. Due to their alkaline nature, these materials are inherently more electrically conductive than ordinary Portland cement, and have therefore seen numerous applications as sensors and self-sensing materials. This review outlines the current state-of-the-art in strain, temperature and moisture sensors that have been developed using alkali activated materials. Sensor fabrication methods, electrical conductivity mechanisms, and comparisons with self-sensing ordinary Portland cements are all outlined to highlight best practice and propose future directions for research",
