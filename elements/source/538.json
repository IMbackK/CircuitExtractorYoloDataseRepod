	"abstract": "Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) are electrochemical techniques to characterize reversibility of electron transfer and impedance at the electrode-solution interface, respectively. Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and conductive polymer PEDOT:PSS are often used to enhance electron transfer at electrode surface. This chapter provides a step-by-step methodology of CV and EIS conducted on screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) modified with rGO-PEDOT:PSS and brief discussion on the CV and EIS results. The CV of rGO-PEDOT:PSS shows a reversible electron transfer in comparison to SPCE modified with PEDOT:PSS.\302\240For EIS, rGO-PEDOT:PSS was found to reduce the Warburg impedance, suggesting enhanced electrode conductivity. These results suggest that rGO-PEDOT:PSS is a suitable material for biosensing purpose",
