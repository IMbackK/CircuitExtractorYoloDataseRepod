	"abstract": "One way to reach a more sustainable cement industry is replacing clinker by additions, such as waste brick powder. The objective of this research is to analyse the influence in the long-term (until 400\342\200\257days) of waste brick powder in the microstructure, durability and mechanical properties of mortars which incorporate up to 20% of this addition as a clinker replacement. The microstructure has been studied with the non-destructive impedance spectroscopy technique. According to the obtained results, mortars with 10% and 20% of brick powder, showed good service properties in the long-term, even better than those made with ordinary Portland cement.The research work included in the paper has been financially supported by project DFP17-0006 \342\200\230\342\200\230Aplicaci\303\263n de un tratamiento t\303\251rmico para mejorar las prestaciones mec\303\241nicas de residuos de mamposter\303\255a como reemplazo de cemento\342\200\235, funded by Universidad de La Frontera (Chile)",
