	"abstract": "This research is focusing on the experimental study of compatibility between Corrosion Inhibitor (CI) and Biocide that include its behavior towards each other. The corrosion research involves experimental analysis and testing to provide information about the reasons for mechanisms in corrosion process and the determination of corrosion rates and the efficiency of corrosion protection",
