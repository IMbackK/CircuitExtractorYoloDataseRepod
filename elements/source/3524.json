	"abstract": "Hydrogen features a very high specific energy density and is therefore a promising candidate for clean fuel from renewable resources. Water electrolysis can convert electrical energy into storable and transportable hydrogen gas. Under acidic conditions, platinum is the most active and stable monometallic catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Yet, platinum is rare and needs to be used efficiently. Here, we report a synthesis concept for colloidal bimetallic platinum\342\200\223ruthenium and rhodium\342\200\223ruthenium nanoparticles (PtRuNP, RhRuNP) and their incorporation into ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) films. The films exhibit high surface area, good electrical conductivity and well-dispersed nanoparticles inside the mesopores. The nanoparticles retain their size, crystallinity and composition during carbonization. In the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), PtRuNP/OMC catalyst films show up to five times higher activity per Pt than Pt/C/Nafion\302\256 and PtRu/C/Nafion\302\256 reference catalysts.TU Berlin, Open-Access-Mittel - 2020European Metrology Research Programme (EMRP), 16ENG0, Hybrid metrology for thin films in energy applications (HyMET)BMBF, 03VP05390, Nanostrukturierte Elektroden der n\303\244chsten Generation f\303\274r eine energieeffiziente Produktion von Chlor - Next-Gen-ChlorBMBF, 03EK3009, Design hocheffizienter Elektrolysekatalysatore",
