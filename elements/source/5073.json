	"abstract": "AbstractA physicochemical model of the I(V) response of amperometric oxygen sensors based in ion conduction is proposed. Although the qualitative behavior of these devices is well known, there is a lack of a quantitative description of the response of the sensors in their normal operation conditions. The model focuses on diffusion across a porous layer and minimization of the oxygen-ion electrochemical potential in steady state. It provides an analytical expression describing the current-voltage dependence in terms of oxygen diffusivity, ionic conductivity, temperature and geometrical parameters. Experimental measurements of our owndesigned amperometric ceramic sensors are in agreement with the proposed model",
