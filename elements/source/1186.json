	"abstract": "In this paper, eleven natural dyes were collected from three trees and used as photosensitizers for dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The cells were fabricated using TiO2 as a semiconducting layer deposited on transparent fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) conductive glass using doctor blade method. The absorption spectra of the extracts were performed in the spectral range from 400 nm to 750 nm. The JV characteristic curves of all fabricated cells were measured and analyzed. The parameters related to the solar cell performance were determined. Moreover, the impedance spectroscopy of the cell with the best performance was investigated",
