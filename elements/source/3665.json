	"abstract": "NiA and NiX zeolites were prepared and characterised using XRD, FTIR and SEM, and subsequently tested as electrodes for hydrogen (HER) and oxygen (OER) evolution reactions in alkaline media. Linear sweep voltammetry and chronoamperometry techniques showed that NiA has higher catalytic activity for these two reactions, as evidenced by higher current densities, which can be correlated with a higher weight fraction of Ni in this electrocatalyst than in the NiX and with its higher conductivity. HER and OER kinetic parameters, including Tafel slope, exchange current density and apparent activation energy were evaluated. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis yielded values of the resistance of the solution, charge transfer and mass transfer, as well as double layer capacitance and pseudo-capacitance of the working electrode, at different potentials and temperatures. Unlike the HER, during which the mass transfer resistance of the adsorbed intermediate is dominant in the case of NiA, the OER impedance response is controlled by the charge transfer process itself at the potentials of interest for these process. The overall resistance related to the HER is lower for NiA than for NiX. \302\251 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LL",
