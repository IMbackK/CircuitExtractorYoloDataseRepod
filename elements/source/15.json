	"abstract": "Impedance spectroscopy is the science of recording and evaluating the impedance of electrical circuit elements as the function of the exciting freguency. The electrical circuit elements can be virtually anything that can be excited by AC voltage sources (conventional discrete electric elements, battery cells and even biological tissues). As battery cells are electrochemical devices, studying them using impedance spectroscopy is electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). In this paper we provide a literature overview of impedance spectroscopy, and propose it as a measurement principle for the t\303\255me- and cost- efficient state-of-health testing of individual Li-ion battery cells for the MegaLux solar vehicle racing team at our Faculty",
