	"abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Today, the popularity of amalgam as restorative material has decreased due to poor esthetic characteristics and mercury contamination with composite resin materials becoming a choice among the both dentists and patients. AIM: The objective of this in-vitro study was to evaluate the effect of pH of dentin bonding agents (Adper Easy Bond and Xeno V) on dentin in relation to push out bond strength of composite restored with Filtek bulk fill posterior restorative composites.MATERIALS AND METHOD: Sixty caries free human molars with no cracks or previous restorations were used for investigation. Standard box-type Class-I Cavities of 3.5 mm x 3.5 mm and depth of 4 mm were prepared on the occlusal surface of the molars. Teeth were randomly divided into 2 groups namely Group A, Group B of 30 teeth each, according to the dentin adhesives applied i.e Adper Easy bond and Xeno V. Two bonding agents with different pH were selected for the study. One was Adper Easy Bond with Ultra mild pH of 2.7. Other was Xeno V Self etch with strong pH of &lt;1.3. Push-out test was performed by placing specimens within a centralizing ring to ensure a centered application of the load, resting on another ring, with a central hole slightly larger than the restoration diameter. The test was performed with a universal Testing Machine to express bond strength in mega pascals (MPa), load value in Newton (N). After testing the push-out bond strength, the samples were analyzed under a stereomicroscope.RESULTS: Adper Easy bond with an ultra mild pH 2.7 is better as compared to Xeno V Self etch with strong pH of &lt;1.3.The most common mode of failure observed with Adper was mixed fracture and cohesive dentin fracture, while in Xeno V, adhesive failure between resin and dentin and cohesive resin fracture was observed. The mean maximum force was significantly more among Adper compared to Xeno V.CONCLUSION: Comparison of dentin bonding agents in this in vitro study revealed that the push out bond strength of Adper Easy performed better than Xeno V",
