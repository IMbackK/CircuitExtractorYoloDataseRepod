	"abstract": "Understanding the factors that influence ion-solvent properties for the fluoride ion in organic solvents is key to the development of useful liquid electrolytes for fluoride-ion batteries. Using both experimental and computational methods, we examined a range of chemical and electrochemical properties for a set of organic solvents in combination with dry N,N,N-trimethylneopentylammonium fluoride (Np\342\202\201F) salt. Results showed that solvent electronic structure strongly influences Np\342\202\201F dissolution, and the pK_a of solvent protons provides a good guide to potential F\342\201\273 reactivity. We found a number of organic solvents capable of dissolving Np\342\202\201F while providing chemically-stable F\342\201\273 in solution and characterized three of them in detail: propionitrile (PN), 2,6-difluoropyridine (2,6-DFP), and bis(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl) ether (BTFE). Arrhenius analysis for Np\342\202\201F/PN, Np\342\202\201F/DFP, and Np\342\202\201F/BTFE electrolytes suggests that DFP facilitates the highest F\342\201\273 ion mobility of the three neat solvents. Electrolyte mixtures of BTFE and amide co-solvents exhibit higher ionic conductivity than the neat solvents. This improved ionic conductivity is attributed to the ability of BTFE:co-solvent mixtures to partition between Np\342\202\201\342\201\272 and F\342\201\273 ion-aggregates, promoting better ion dissociation",
