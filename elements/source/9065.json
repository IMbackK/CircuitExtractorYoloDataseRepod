	"abstract": "New benzo[h]quinolin-10-ol derivatives with one or two 2-cyanoacrylic acid units were\r\nsynthesized with a good yield in a one-step condensation reaction. Chemical structure and purity\r\nwere confirmed using NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis, respectively. The investigation of\r\ntheir thermal, electrochemical and optical properties was carried out based on differential scanning\r\ncalorimetry, cyclic voltammetry, electronic absorption and photoluminescence measurements. The\r\nanalysis of the optical, electrochemical and properties was supported by density functional theory\r\nstudies. The synthesized molecules were applied in dye-sensitized solar cells as sensitizers and cosensitizers\r\nwith commercial N719. The thickness and surface morphology of prepared photoanodes\r\nwas studied using optical, scanning electron and atomic force microscopes. Due to the utilization of\r\nbenzo[h]quinolin-10-ol derivatives as co-sensitizers, the better photovoltaic performance of fabricated\r\ndevices compared to a reference cell based on a neat N719 was demonstrated. Additionally, the effect\r\nof co-adsorbent chemical structure (cholic acid, deoxycholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid) on\r\nDSSC efficiency was explained based on the density functional theory",
