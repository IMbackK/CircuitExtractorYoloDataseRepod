	"abstract": "AbstractThis work deals with the development of a disposable electrochemical biosensor for the speciﬁc detection of short DNA sequences. The sensor is an amperometric transducer with three planar electrodes, comprising a working, a counter and a pseudo-reference electrode, all made of a gold layer over a polycarbonate substrate. For the development of the genosensor, the working electrode was modiﬁed using thiol-tethered 33-mer DNA probe by chemisorptions, in a concentration range from 0.1 μM to 5 μM. Immobilization of ssDNA on gold surface was monitored with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) in Fe(CN)64−/13− and Ruthenium(II)/(III) solutions. The time dependence of ssDNA probe immobilization was also studied. The hybridization detection is then compared with EIS and DPV measurements",
