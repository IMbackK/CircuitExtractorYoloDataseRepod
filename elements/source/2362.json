	"abstract": "Mechanochemical synthesis o ers unique possibility of perovskite phase formation at\r\nambient conditions that is very attractive (simplifies production, allows strict stoichiometry control and\r\nbrings economic benefits). In this work the mechanochemical synthesis has been used for preparation\r\nofBa1xCaxTiO3 (0.2   x   0.3) powders from simple oxides. The 20 h milled powders have been\r\nuniaxially pressed and sintered in order to get the ceramic samples. The sample morphologies\r\nhave been observed by scanning electron microscopy. Dielectric and impedance studies have\r\nbeen performed on ceramics. The obtained results indicate that the two mechanism of doping\r\noccurred. The first one is observed for the lower calcium concentration (below 0.3) and consists of the\r\nintroduction of calcium ion into the A site of the perovskite structure. The second one is observed for\r\nthe higher calcium concentration (equal 0.3). In this case the calcium ions partially occupies the B site\r\nin the perovskite structure. Both cases have di erent influence on the final properties of the ceramics\r\nbecause they induce di erent defects",
