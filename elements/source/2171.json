	"abstract": "International audienceThe influence of the sintering conditions on the electrochemical properties of the proton conducting electrolyte BaCe0.85Y0.15O3-delta (BCY15) and Ni - based BCY15 cermet anode for application in high temperature proton conducting fuel cell are investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results show that at lower sintering temperatures due to the formation of parasitic Y2O3 phase an increase of both the electrolyte and electrode resistances is observed. This effect is strongly reduced by enhancement of the sintering temperature. The obtained BCY15 conductivity (sigma = 2.5x10(-2) S/cm at 700 degrees C) is comparable with that of the best proton conducting materials, while the BCY15-Ni cermet (with ASR = 2.5 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C) needs further optimization. The results of impedance investigations of BCY15 as proton conducting electrolyte and cermet anode have been applied in development of innovative high temperature dual membrane fuel cell",
